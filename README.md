So you want to plan a family trip to US national parks, but which one should you pick? How about slecting your park by the google rating? 

## Extract
Data sources include national parks json and google places API

National park JSON from data world
https://data.world/kevinnayar/us-national-parks

Google places API
https://developers.google.com/places/supported_types#table1
Some of the challenges with the google places APi included getting inconsistent results when calling the place details API. This is an API issue not a code issue.
